SiYuan Notes AI Assistant Plugin, which enables rich functionalities such as Q&A and editing based on the content of SiYuan Notes.

> [!NOTE]
> **New Feature: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support**
>
> This branch introduces support for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, allowing seamless integration with external tools and data.
> - **Server Management**: Configure and manage custom MCP servers (stdio, SSE) directly within the plugin settings.
> - **Tool Integration**: Tools exposed by connected MCP servers are automatically available for use in Agent mode, extending the AI's capabilities.
>- **preset modification**: preset selection and editing mode change, which can directly switch the preset without switching from setting.

**Note**: Using this plugin requires you to prepare your own API keys from AI platforms. The plugin itself does not provide AI services. Please comply with the terms of use and privacy policies of each platform.

> For friends who need to use top-tier models like GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 4.5, etc.
> - Recommended [V3 API Website](https://api.gpt.ge/register?aff=fQIZ). It's very easy to use, pay-as-you-go, supports various AI models, and can save you a lot of money compared to using the official API.

If you like my plugin, you are welcome to give a star on the GitHub repository and offer appreciation via WeChat. This will motivate me to continue improving this plugin and developing new ones.

Maintaining plugins is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Personal time and energy are limited. Open source is about sharing, but it does not mean I have to waste my time implementing features for users for free.

I will gradually improve features that I need. Appreciation can expedite updates. For some features I think can be improved but are not currently necessary, they may require appreciation to be prioritized (marked with an appreciation tag and the required amount). Features that are not needed or are very complicated to implement will have their issues closed directly without consideration.

Friends who have accumulated appreciation totaling 50 RMB and wish to add me on WeChat can send an email to <span data-type="a" data-href="mailto:achuan-2@outlook.com">achuan-2@outlook.com</span> to request adding as a friend (If the appreciation does not reach 50 RMB, I will not reply to the email or add you as a friend, as I do not wish to be a free customer service representative).
